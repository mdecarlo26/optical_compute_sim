# Simulation of Optical Computing for High-Speed AI and Signal Processing

## Overview
This project explores the potential of optical computing to overcome the limitations of traditional electronic processors in terms of power consumption and speed. By leveraging the parallel nature of light and the ability of optical systems to perform fast Fourier transforms, we aim to develop a simulation framework that integrates optical and electronic components for AI acceleration and signal processing.

## Key Objectives
1. **Fourier Optics Convolution Simulation**: Simulate lens-based or waveguide-based Fourier transforms for matrix multiplications and convolutions used in deep learning.
2. **Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM) Parallelism**: Model multiple optical channels operating at different wavelengths to perform parallel computations.
3. **Hybrid Optical-Electronic AI Pipelines**: Create a framework where optical accelerators handle linear operations, while electronic hardware executes nonlinear activations.
4. **Comparative Benchmarks**: Evaluate the performance of optical simulations against GPU- and FPGA-based solutions in terms of speed, energy consumption, accuracy, and scalability.
5. **Guidance for Hardware Prototypes**: Provide recommendations for future physical implementations, including key system parameters and design considerations.

## Methodology
The project employs a multi-phase simulation approach:
- **Fourier Optics for High-Speed Convolutions**: Develop simulations of lens-based 4f systems and compare their performance with digital FFT-based methods.
- **WDM Parallelism**: Simulate multiple optical channels for parallel processing and evaluate their throughput and energy efficiency.
- **Hybrid Architectures**: Integrate optical convolution blocks with electronic processors and model the data conversion overheads.

## Expected Outcomes
- A validated simulation framework that integrates optical components with AI workflows.
- Quantitative evidence supporting or challenging the viability of optical computing solutions.
- Design insights into the trade-offs between purely optical systems and hybrid approaches.
- Recommendations for future hardware prototypes.

## Conclusion
This project aims to demonstrate the potential advantages of optical computing for AI and high-speed signal processing, providing a foundation for future photonic hardware development.
